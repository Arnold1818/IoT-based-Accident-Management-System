# Vehicle Accident Management System

A cost-effective embedded system that promptly detects vehicle collisions, accurately locates accident sites, and notifies nearby emergency services such as hospitals and police stations. This project integrates modern hardware modules to ensure timely response and assistance during road accidents.

## üß† Abstract

Road accidents are a leading cause of death globally, often worsened by delays in emergency assistance. This system leverages Arduino UNO, GPS, GSM, collision sensors, and SD card modules to build an efficient and reliable accident detection and notification system.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Automatic accident detection using collision sensors
- Real-time location tracking with GPS
- Emergency alert via GSM module
- Identifies and contacts nearest hospital and police station
- Uses Haversine formula for distance calculation
- Stores responder data (coordinates, phone numbers) on SD card

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Components Used

- **Arduino UNO**
- **YL99 Collision Sensor**
- **GPS Module (NEO 7M)**
- **GSM Module (SIM900A)**
- **SD Card Module**

---

## üîÅ Workflow

1. **Detection:** Collision sensors placed on all sides detect accidents.
2. **Location Tracking:** GPS captures real-time coordinates of the accident.
3. **Responder Matching:** Haversine formula is used to find the nearest hospital and police station from SD card records.
4. **Notification:** Emergency contacts are notified through GSM via SMS/calls.

## üß™ Testing & Results

- Successfully tested under various conditions.
- Accurate location tracking except minor delays (~29s) in dense cloud areas.
- Displays real-time coordinates and contact details via serial monitor.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Limitations

### Challenges
- **Software Serial Conflicts:** Arduino UNO can't handle simultaneous GPS and GSM input.
  - **Solution:** Used dual Arduino setup with intercommunication.
  
### Limitations
- **Poor Weather Conditions:** GPS delays in dense clouds.
- **Low Signal Areas:** GSM communication fails in rural/low coverage regions.
